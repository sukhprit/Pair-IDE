                         Aim   :   Energia + wiring + arduino + AI  = Pair IDE  
I am working on integration of all open source electronics platform which will be easy to use 
for making  projects and developing ideas.
Pair IDE is the Modified version of Arduino to build easy  platform for students and it uses Arduino,Processing and AVR sources.
I have modified and integrated all open source platfrom in Pair-IDE  so that it contains libraries of arduino, wiring, energia 
and my own personal libraries for increasing its productivity.Pair-IDE is Forked from arduino and processing.

                                          open source hardware  & software commmunity       
  
                           Pair IDE forked from Arduino and libraries forked from energia / wiring /processing 					
						  
		  I am also working  on AI hardware's and robotics hardware's  to turn  ideas to Reality.
                 
                   
          Thank you.
