             Modified & Developed by Ajay soni 
                         Aim   :   Energia + wiring + arduino + AI  = Pair IDE  
I am working on integration of all open source electronics platform which will be easy to use 
for making  projects and developing ideas.
Pair IDE is the Modified version of Arduino to build easy  platform for students and it uses Arduino,Processing and AVR sources.
I have modified and integrated Pair-IDE  so that it contains libraries of arduino, wiring, energia and my own personal libraries for increasing its productivity.
  (This is Non Profit Organization for helping  students and Researcher to making projects and products development)

          I am also working  on AI hardware's and robotics hardware's  to turn  ideas to Reality.
                 
                   
          Thank you.
