                         Aim   :   Energia + wiring + arduino + AI  = Pair IDE  
I am working for integreight all open source electronics platform  with in the one platform for easy to use 
for making our projects and development on ideas.
Pair IDE is the Modified version of Arduino  to build more  easy  platform for students.
Pair IDE uses of Arduino , Processing and avr sources.
Pair IDE also uses of libraries of Wiring ,energia and arduino for integreight with in the IDE
and third party libraries are also integreighted.

  (This is Non Profit Organization for helping of students and Researcher to making projects and products development)

          I am also working  on AI hardware's and robotics hardware's  to make  ideas to Reality.
                  ( Please contribute for development in the hardware's and software )
                   
          Thank you.
